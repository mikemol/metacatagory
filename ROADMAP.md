## Notes

This document appends structured roadmap steps and deferred snapshots at render time.

## Structured Roadmaps

* **Provide algebraic structures for representing and manipulating ambiguity in parse spaces.** — Enables formal treatment of ambiguity as algebraic object. [status: not-started]

Target: `src/agda/Plan/CIM/Ambiguity.agda`

* **Establish metric structures on semantic spaces for distance/similarity calculations.** — Enables quantitative semantic reasoning and optimization. [status: not-started]

Target: `src/agda/Plan/CIM/Metricization.agda`

* **Define compositional transformation operations on semantic objects.** — Enables systematic rewriting and protocol evolution. [status: not-started]

Target: `src/agda/Plan/CIM/TransformationSystem.agda`

* **Implement functorial mappings between semantic and computational spaces.** — Enables formal structure-preserving transformations. [status: not-started]

Target: `src/agda/Plan/CIM/FunctorialConstructs.agda`

* **Integrate 2D gating logic (Tension/Resonance) into parser and protocol records, explicitly cross-referencing ambiguity, metricization, transformation system, and functorial constructs.** — Enables composable phase space modeling, creative/insightful parse acceptance, and pruning of non-sequitur/hallucination nodes. Supports recursive revisiting for grammar induction, protocol refinement, and functorial traceability. [status: not-started]

Target: `src/agda/Plan/CIM/Elasticity.agda, parser.py, dashboard.py, src/agda/Plan/CIM/Ambiguity.agda, src/agda/Plan/CIM/Metricization.agda, src/agda/Plan/CIM/TransformationSystem.agda, src/agda/Plan/CIM/FunctorialConstructs.agda`   Depends on: `Provide algebraic structures for representing and manipulating ambiguity in parse spaces. — src/agda/Plan/CIM/Ambiguity.agda, Establish metric structures on semantic spaces for distance/similarity calculations. — src/agda/Plan/CIM/Metricization.agda, Define compositional transformation operations on semantic objects. — src/agda/Plan/CIM/TransformationSystem.agda, Implement functorial mappings between semantic and computational spaces. — src/agda/Plan/CIM/FunctorialConstructs.agda`

* **Implement topological inflation: upgrade crowded semantic categories to higher-dimensional polytopes to relieve tension.** — Enables composable category expansion, tension relief, and dynamic geometry for semantic protocols. Supports recursive revisiting and concept differentiation. [status: not-started]

Target: `src/agda/Plan/CIM/PolytopeExpansion.agda, nedge_topology/mitosis.py`

* **Implement Mitosis Engine to monitor topological tension and inflate categories to dynamic polytopes as needed.** — Enables dynamic, composable category geometry, tension monitoring, and concept differentiation. Supports recursive revisiting and protocol evolution. [status: not-started]

Target: `nedge_topology/mitosis.py, nedge_topology/parser.py, dashboard.py, src/agda/Plan/CIM/PolytopeExpansion.agda`

* **Integrate Earley parsing, RoPE, and symmetry group concepts into a unified topological parser. Treat syntax as a manifold and ambiguity as vector superposition.** — Enables composable geometric and topological integration, active topological pruning, and algebraic superposition for ambiguity. Supports recursive revisiting, fiber bundle architecture, and advanced induction/training features. [status: not-started]

Target: `nedge_topology/parser.py, nedge_topology/train.py, nedge_topology/mitosis.py, nedge_topology/search.py, dashboard.py, src/agda/Plan/CIM/RotationalTransport.agda, src/agda/Plan/CIM/TopologicalGating.agda, src/agda/Plan/CIM/TopologicalSuperposition.agda`   Depends on: `Implement topological inflation: upgrade crowded semantic categories to higher-dimensional polytopes to relieve tension. — src/agda/Plan/CIM/PolytopeExpansion.agda, nedge_topology/mitosis.py, Implement Mitosis Engine to monitor topological tension and inflate categories to dynamic polytopes as needed. — nedge_topology/mitosis.py, nedge_topology/parser.py, dashboard.py, src/agda/Plan/CIM/PolytopeExpansion.agda, Integrate 2D gating logic (Tension/Resonance) into parser and protocol records, explicitly cross-referencing ambiguity, metricization, transformation system, and functorial constructs. — src/agda/Plan/CIM/Elasticity.agda, parser.py, dashboard.py, src/agda/Plan/CIM/Ambiguity.agda, src/agda/Plan/CIM/Metricization.agda, src/agda/Plan/CIM/TransformationSystem.agda, src/agda/Plan/CIM/FunctorialConstructs.agda`
