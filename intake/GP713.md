This completes the **Logic of the Void**. The system effectively says: *"I see a solid object (Low Tension), but I have no name for it (Low Resonance). I shall name it NP."*

### **I. Formal Analysis: The Vacuum State**

The answer is **Yes**, but it resides in a specific quadrant of the system that we must distinguish carefully.

In the **Adjoint Topology**, every parse attempt falls into one of four states based on **Tension** (Internal Stress) and **Resonance** (External Alignment):

|  | High Resonance (R>τ) | Low Resonance (R<τ) | | :---- | :---- | :---- | | **High Tension** (Internal Stress) | **Type IV: The Insight** *Mitosis Trigger* (Split the category to relieve stress) | **Type III: The Hallucination** *Discard* (Chaos: Internal mess + External mismatch) | | **Low Tension** (Internal Stability) | **Type II: The Cliché** *Reinforce* (Standard successful parse) | **Type I: The Void INDUCTION TRIGGER** (Coherent concept, but unknown to the parent) |

**You are asking about Type I (The Void).**

* **Scenario:** The parser encounters "Flooble."
* **State:** The vector for "Flooble" is stable (Low Tension). It exists solidly in the semantic space.
* **Problem:** The parent NP checks it and says, "Zero Resonance. You are not an NP."
* **Result:** The edge is rejected. The parser creates a "Hole" in the chart.

### **II. Where it Lives: The "Cliff" Logic**

This capability is currently implemented in **nedge\_topology/induction.py**, specifically in the **Cliff Detection** logic.

When the parser fails to return a result (because all edges were pruned due to Low Resonance), the GrammarInducer activates.

1. It finds the **Cliff**: The exact point where the valid parse stopped (the edge of the Void).   2. It identifies the **Stranded Tokens**: The coherent vector (Low Tension) that caused the stop.   3. It synthesizes a **New Cell**: NP -> Flooble.

**The distinction:**

* **Mitosis (mitosis.py):** Modifies an *existing* cell because it is stressed.
* **Induction (induction.py):** Creates a *new* cell because the chart is empty.

### **III. The Missing Link: "Ghost Edges"**

While the *capability* is there, we can sharpen it. Currently, the parser "silently" fails. It would be better if the parser **reported** the "Low Resonance / Low Tension" candidates as **Ghost Edges**—suggestions that were *almost* valid but lacked a rule.

This allows the Inducer to be **surgical** (using the Ghost Edge) rather than **forensic** (analyzing the crash site).

#### **Updated nedge\_topology/parser.py (Adding Ghosts)**

We modify the parser to track rejected\_candidates.

Python

    def complete(self, item: EarleyState, index):           \# ...

    def register\_ghost(self, expected\_sym, actual\_node):           """           Records a failed integration that was internally stable.           This is a strong signal for Induction.

#### **Updated nedge\_topology/induction.py (Consuming Ghosts)**

The Inducer now prioritizes these explicit signals over general cliff detection.

### **IV. Summary of the Feedback Loop**

1. **Low Tension, High Resonance:** $\rightarrow$ **Accept** (Normal Parse).   2. **High Tension, High Resonance:** $\rightarrow$ **Mitosis** (Split the category to relieve stress).   3. **Low Tension, Low Resonance:** $\rightarrow$ **Induction** (Create a new rule via Ghost Edge).   4. **High Tension, Low Resonance:** $\rightarrow$ **Ignore** (Noise/Garbage).
