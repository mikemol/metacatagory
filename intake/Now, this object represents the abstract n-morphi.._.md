That is correct, and it is the central tenet of the $\mathbf{Coherence\ Hierarchy\ Induction\ Principle\ (CHIP)}$.

The object constructed---the $\mathbf{packed-node}$ containing the $\mathbf{BraidedInheritanceFunctor}$---represents an abstract $\mathbf{n}$-morphism (or $\mathbf{n}$-cell) that is **one dimension higher** than the components it resolves. It is structurally defined as a **Homological Filling** operation.

Here is the formal breakdown of the dimensional ascent:

### I. The **$\mathbf{n} \to \mathbf{n+1}$** Dimensional Ascent

The dimension ($\mathbf{n}$) of the synthesized object depends entirely on the dimension of the ambiguity it resolves:

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   **Structure          **Ambiguity Resolved       **Resulting Synthesized         **Dimensionality**   Synthesized**        (Input n-Cells)**          Object**                           -------------------- -------------------------- ------------------------------- -----------------------   **Category of        Ambiguity between          **$\mathbf{packed-node}$**   **2-morphism** (The   Morphisms            **0-Cells**                of $\mathbf{2}$-Cells (The   initial   ($\mathbf{Hom(A,   ($\mathbf{A}$ and       Braiding Event)                 $\mathbf{2}$-Cell)   B)}$)**             $\mathbf{B}$)

**Adjunction         Ambiguity between          **$\mathbf{packed-node}$**   **3-morphism**   Structure            **1-Cells**                of $\mathbf{3}$-Cells           ($\mathbf{F        ($\mathbf{F}$ and                                          \dashv G}$)**      $\mathbf{G}$'s                                                                 canonical paths)

**Categorical Law    Ambiguity between          **$\mathbf{packed-node}$**   **4-morphism**   Coherence**          **2-Cells** (e.g., two     of $\mathbf{4}$-Cells                                different proofs of the                                                            $\mathbf{Associator}$                                                           coherence)                                                    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The general rule, mandated by the $\mathbf{Coherence\ Witness}$, is: **An $\mathbf{n}$-Cell Ambiguity is resolved by constructing an $\mathbf{(n+1)}$-Cell.** .

### II. Structural Role of the **$\mathbf{n}$**-Morphism

The $\mathbf{n}$-morphism constructed by the braiding event serves two critical roles:

1. **Resolution (Coherence Witness):** The $\mathbf{packed-node}$ is     > the explicit record of the $\mathbf{Emergent\ Metric}$     > required to prove the equivalence of the components. This metric     > (the $\mathbf{coherence-cost}$) is then encoded into the     > $\mathbf{GradedVectorSpace}$, thus stabilizing the entire     > system at the new structural rank.

2. **Abstraction (New $\mathbf{0}$-Cell):** Once constructed, this     > new $\mathbf{(n+1)}$-morphism can be treated as a     > **higher-order $\mathbf{PropertyNode}$** (a new     > $\mathbf{0}$-Cell input) for future braiding operations. For     > instance, the **Adjunction Structure** ($\mathbf{3}$-morphism)     > becomes a single, atomic object that can be braided with another     > $\mathbf{3}$-morphism to construct a $\mathbf{4}$-morphism,     > maintaining the recursive hierarchy necessary to model complex     > mathematical structures.
