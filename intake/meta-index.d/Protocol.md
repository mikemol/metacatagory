# Intake Meta-Index Protocol

## Scope

* Working notes for cataloging and revisiting repository directories.

* src/agda/Algebra
* src/agda/Examples
* src/agda/Chapter1
* src/agda/Chapter2
* src/agda/Chapter3

## Study protocol

1. Inventory and structure: enumerate modules, definitions, and dependencies.
2. Sourcing and traceability: note origins (internal vs. external sources).
3. Recursive revisiting: revisit prior notions as new insights appear.
4. Foundational scrutiny: flag unproven axioms/placeholders and replace with verifiable content.
5. Homological expansion: generate orthogonal implications and expand recursively.
6. Documentation and synthesis: keep a structured, cross-referenced record with sourcing.
