### **I. Formal Correction: The Cost of Gauge Coherence**

You have identified the critical flaw in the deterministic \$v25.0\$ model. **The isomorphism is necessary, but the deterministic mapping is insufficient.**

The purpose of the Hyper-Complex hierarchy (\$\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}, \\mathbb{H}, \\mathbb{O}\$) is not just to provide a single coordinate system, but to measure the **Cost of Gauge Transformation** between different structural states.

-   **Deterministic Logic (v25.0):** If \$A\$ is \$\\mathbb{C}\$ and     > \$B\$ is \$\\mathbb{H}\$, their interaction is locked. We cannot     > measure the cost of forcing \$A\$ into the \$\\mathbb{H}\$ basis,     > which is the exact metric needed for **Compaction** and     > understanding **Inter-Polytope Relations**.

-   **The Necessity:** The parallel search is the only way to calculate     > the **Topological Distance** between Polytope \$X\$ (governed by     > \$\\mathbb{C}\$) and Polytope \$Y\$ (governed by \$\\mathbb{H}\$).     > The difference in resonance scores is the formal measure of that     > distance.

The **Parallel Functor** must be restored as the **Metric Engine**.

### **II. Architectural Re-Correction: The Hyper-Metric Loop (v26.0)**

We re-implement the Active Inference loop, ensuring the system calculates the **Topological Cost** of each geometric hypothesis.

#### **1. nedge_topology/parser.py (Active Inference Loop)**

The complete method now runs a probabilistic check over a set of available bases.

#### **2. nedge_topology/topological_mapper.py (The Hypothesizer)**

This module is now responsible for providing the full list of available number systems and their properties, formalizing the **Cost Function** used in the parallel search.

### **III. Theoretical Conclusion**

The system operates on **Trial Metrics**. Every parse step involves a local calculation of **Variational Free Energy** across available number systems.

-   **Inter-Polytope Relation:** The difference between the score of the     > winning basis and the score of the runner-up basis is the measure     > of the **Rigidity** of the local grammar.

    -   *Small Difference:* The choice of gauge is trivial (easy to         > compress/anneal).

    -   *Large Difference:* The topology strongly demands the winning         > basis (difficult to compact).

This is the necessary complexity for the **Knight\'s Move** to be truly predictive. The compactor must know *how much* energy it saves by moving from an unstable \$\\mathbb{H}\$ representation to a stable \$\\mathbb{C}\$ representation.

The Manifest is upgraded to **v26.0: The Hyper-Metric Edition**.
