*   *Action:* It clones the grammar rule NP -> ... into NP' -> ..., effectively refining the symmetry group to reduce the tension in the system (Relaxation).

### **I. Formal Correction: The "Elasticity" of Meaning**

I formally correct the elision of the **Orthogonality of Error**.

You have identified the critical separation between **Internal Consistency** (Tension) and **External Validity** (Resonance). Treating them as a single scalar "score" conflates two fundamentally different signals:

1.  **Tension ($T$):** The **Internal Stress**.      \* *Definition:* $\Delta(\text{Discrete}, \text{Continuous})$.      \* *Meaning:* How much does this node fight its own structural classification?      \* *High Tension:* Poetic usage, metaphor, neologism, or "bending the rules."      \* *Low Tension:* Literal, standard, dictionary usage.   2. **Resonance ($R$):** The **External Alignment**.      \* *Definition:* $\langle \text{Parent} | \text{Child} \rangle$.      \* *Meaning:* How well does this node fit into the current syntactic slot?      \* *High Resonance:* "This is exactly what I expected."      \* *Low Resonance:* "This is a non-sequitur."

By separating these, we define the **Phase Space of Meaning**.

### **II. The Quadrants of the Parse**

We can map every edge attempt onto a 2D plane.

|                                    | Low Resonance (R<τ)                                                                                                            | High Resonance (R>τ)                                                                                            | | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | **Low Tension** (Rigid Structure)  | **Type I: The Non-Sequitur** *"The rock slept."* Structurally valid, but semantically irrelevant. **Action: Prune.**            | **Type II: The Cliché** *"The dog barked."* Perfect structure, expected meaning. **Action: Accept (Fast Path).** | | **High Tension** (Fluid Structure) | **Type III: The Hallucination** *"Colorless green ideas."* Stretching structure for no semantic payoff. **Action: Hard Prune.** | **Type IV: The Insight** *"Time flies."* Bends the rules, but resonates deeply. **Action: Accept & Highlight.**  |

*Metaphor: Type II is the Linear Elastic region (safe). Type IV is the Yield Point (plastic deformation, where learning happens). Type I/III are Fracture points.*

### **III. Operational Update: The Elastic Gate**

We modify parser.py to implement this 2D decision logic. We treat **Tension** not as a penalty, but as a **Cost**. We treat **Resonance** as the **Payment**.

*Rule:* "If you want to create High Tension (be creative), you must pay with High Resonance (be relevant)."

### **IV. Visualization: The Quadrant Plot**

We update the **Dashboard** to explicitly visualize this distinction. Instead of just a 3D manifold, we add a specific **"Elasticity Analysis"** tab that plots every edge in the graph on a $T$ vs $R$ scatter plot.

#### **Updated dashboard.py (Snippet)**

### **V. Why This Matters for Induction**

This distinction is the trigger for your **Grammar Induction**:

1.  **Parse Failure (Zero Results):** Total breakdown.   2. **Parse Success (Low Resonance):** The parser "forced" a fit, but it's bad.      \* *Trigger:* **Refinement**. Adjust weights/prototypes (Hebbian).   3. **Parse Success (High Tension):** The parser found a valid path, but it had to "stretch" the geometry (Type IV).      \* *Trigger:* **Mitosis**.      \* If NP -> Time consistently has High Tension (because "Time" behaves differently than "Apple"), the system should **split** the NP category into NP\_Abstract and NP\_Concrete.      \* High Tension is the signal that your rigid SymNum symmetry group is *too coarse* for the reality of the data.

### **VI. Next Step**

Would you like me to implement the **"Mitosis" Logic** in the GrammarInducer?

*   *Function:* It scans the graph for nodes with consistently High Tension.
