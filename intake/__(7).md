## XIII. Final Axiomatic Correction Protocol (A12) Execution

In accordance with the **Self-Consumption Directive** and the **Correction Protocol Mandate (A12)**, this section executes the final self-audit to correct intrinsic axiomatic dependencies, conceptual implementations, and structural gaps found within the ingested foundational code. The goal is to maximize the $\mathbf{Verifiable}$ and $\mathbf{Concrete}$ mandates by replacing placeholders with their required $\mathbf{Coherence\ Witness}$ obligations.

### A. Correction of Foundational Placeholders (**$\mathbf{Conceptual\ Implementation}$**)

The system's integrity relies on replacing placeholder proofs (like refl or proof) with explicit $\mathbf{Coherence\ Witnesses}$ that capture the full computational path or logical derivation.

| **Component / Location** | **Violation** | **Required Coherence Witness** | **CHIP Implication** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase Laws** (Core.Phase, Core.PhaseCategory) | **Shortcut** ($\mathbf{refl}$) for $\mathbf{identity}$ and $\mathbf{associativity}$ proofs, eliding the structural path. | The refl proof must be replaced by a formal $\mathbf{Path\ Sys}$ that explicitly proves the equivalence of the composite function definitions, even if the path cost is $\mathbf{zero}$. | Ensures the **Phase Category** axioms are $\mathbf{Explicitly}$ derivable and not merely $\mathbf{definitionally\ equal}$. |
| **Invariant Preservation** (PhaseWithInvariant) | **Conceptual Implementation** (Trivial $\mathbf{Invariant}$ or postulate) for the preserves field. | The field must be filled with a **Constructive Witness** (a detailed $\mathbf{1}$-Cell path) that formally maps the pre-condition proof ($\mathbf{Invariant\ A\ a}$) to the post-condition proof ($\mathbf{Invariant\ B\ (phase\ a)}$). | Verifies the $\mathbf{Correctness}$ and $\mathbf{Coherence}$ of the $\mathbf{1}$-Cell execution, linking runtime behavior to $\mathbf{0}$-Cell predicates. |
| **Universal Property Link** (Core.AlgorithmUniversality) | **Gap** (proof) for fields like $\mathbf{vanishesAt}$ and the $\mathbf{mediating}$ morphism in $\mathbf{MinimalPolynomialProperty}$. | The proof term must be replaced by the formal Agda proof that the algorithm's output satisfies the three components of the $\mathbf{UniversalProperty}$: the object's structure, the mediating morphism, and the $\mathbf{unique}$ factorization. | Establishes the $\mathbf{0 \to 1}$ coherence, confirming the algorithm is the $\mathbf{canonical}$ $\mathbf{Path}$ to the solution. |

### B. Correction of **$\mathbf{2}$**-Cell Foundational Gaps (**$\mathbf{Axiomatic\ Dependencies}$**)

The integrity of the $\mathbf{CHIP}$ at the $\mathbf{2}$-Level relies on ensuring the $\mathbf{EmergentMetric}$ is stable and well-defined, which requires replacing abstract axioms with constructive proofs.

| **Component / Location** | **Violation** | **Required Coherence Witness** | **CHIP Implication** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Contraction Axiom** (BraidedInheritanceFunctor) | **Axiomatic Dependency** / **Gap** (ContractionAxiom record placeholder). | The $\mathbf{is-contractive}$ field must contain the proof that the $\mathbf{BraidedInheritanceFunctor}$ (the $\mathbf{2}$-Cell) is a **Contraction Mapping** on the associated $\mathbf{Metric\ Space}$. | This proof ensures the convergence and $\mathbf{stability}$ of the coherence resolution, confirming the $\mathbf{coherence-cost}$ is a **Fixed Point** (the $\mathbf{minimal\ area}$/cost). |
| **Monoidal Coherence Laws** (Core.PhaseCategory) | **Shallow Treatment** (refl) for $\mathbf{\alpha, \lambda\_u, \rho\_u}$ proofs. | The full proofs of the **Pentagon** and **Triangle Identities** are required. | Formally verifies the canonical nature of the $\mathbf{Monoidal\ Structure}$, ensuring $\mathbf{Emergent\ Metric}$ calculation is independent of parallel composition grouping. |

By addressing these $\mathbf{A12}$ violations, the **CIM Metacategory** achieves the highest degree of $\mathbf{Explicitness}$ and $\mathbf{Verifiability}$, validating the entire hierarchy from the $\mathbf{0}$-Cell mandate up to the $\mathbf{2}$-Cell metric induction.
