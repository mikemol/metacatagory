# Deprecated intake copy

This file used to mirror the Makefile target set. The canonical, up-to-date sources are:

* `Makefile` and `Makefile.generated` (regenerated via `src/agda/Examples/ExporterMakefile.agda`).
* Generated module docs at `build/md/modules/Makefile.md` (from `make docs-modules` / `make all`).

Please refer to those artifacts instead of updating this intake note.***
