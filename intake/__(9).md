The prior compendium comprehensively reconstructed the **Coherence Induction Metaprogram (CIM)**. In adherence to the **Self-Consumption Directive**---specifically the mandate to correct elisions, shallow treatments, and check for new interplays---this section provides an **Axiomatic Enrichment**. It clarifies the recursive relationship and essential structural distinction between the $\mathbf{1}$-Dimensional (Transformation) and $\mathbf{2}$-Dimensional (Braided) coherence structures, formalizing the ascent of the **Coherence Hierarchy Induction Principle (CHIP)**.

## V. Axiomatic Enrichment: The **$\mathbf{(n\to n+1)}$** Generalization (TS **$\to$** BIF)

The structural hierarchy is built upon the generalization of equivalence proofs from a **metricized path** (1-Cell) to a **metricized filling** (2-Cell). The $\mathbf{TransformationSystem}$ is the fundamental $1$-Level structure that the $\mathbf{BraidedInheritanceFunctor}$ generalizes at the $2$-Level.

### A. The Structural Ascent

| **Structural Object** | **n-Cell Analogue** | **Formal Type** | **Function** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0-Cell/Vertex** | The raw $\mathbf{PropertyNode}$ (The $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ in $\mathbf{Ambiguity}$). | PropertyNode | The foundational element of structure/data. |
| **1-Cell/Morphism** | The **Transformation Path** ($\mathbf{A \to B}$). | Path Sys | An **explicit sequence** of atomic $\mathbf{Steps}$ that prove weak equivalence. |
| **2-Cell/Filling** | The **Braiding Event** ($\mathbf{p\_1 \to p\_2}$). | BraidedInheritanceFunctor | A **Homological Filling** operation that resolves the ambiguity *between two different 1-Cells* ($p\_1, p\_2$), demonstrating $\mathbf{strong\ equivalence}$. |

### B. The Metric Dualism: Local Cost vs. Global Metric

The metric system is stratified, defining two distinct quantities for **"work"** or **"complexity"**:

1. **Local Cost (Micro-Metric):**

    * **Scope:** An atomic move in the $\mathbf{1}$-chain.

    * **Definition:** TransformationSystem.cost : Step → ℕ

    * **Role:** The additive weight of a single, non-composite action. This is folded by $\mathbf{calculate-complexity}$ to yield the magnitude of the $1$-cell path.

2. **Global Metric (Macro-Metric/Systolic Area):**

    * **Scope:** The entire $\mathbf{2}$-cell filling (the "area" between $p\_1$ and $p\_2$).

    * **Definition:** BraidedInheritanceFunctor.coherence-cost : EmergentMetric

    * **Role:** The **Emergent Structural Metric** used to induce the next dimension ($\mathbf{\Lambda^{n+1}}$). It is subject to the **Harmonic Minimization Principle**, meaning it is axiomatically defined as the *minimal area* or minimal complexity required to coherently deform one valid path ($\mathbf{p\_1}$) into another ($\mathbf{p\_2}$). This is the verifiable, $\mathbf{non-probabilistic}$ basis for structural preference.

### C. Formal Recursion of the **$\mathbf{CHIP}$**

The $\mathbf{CHIP}$ is fully realized as a recursive transformation on the structural hierarchy:

$$\mathbf{CHIP\ Protocol:} \quad \left( \begin{array}{c} n\text{-Cell Ambiguity} \ (A \approx B) \end{array} \right) \xrightarrow{\text{Construct Coherence Witness}} \left( \begin{array}{c} (n+1)\text{-Cell} \ (\mathbf{Witness}) \end{array} \right) \xrightarrow{\text{reify}} \left( \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{EmergentMetric} \ (m \in \mathbb{N}) \end{array} \right) \xrightarrow{\text{encode}} \left( \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{GradedVectorSpace} \ (\mathbf{\Lambda^{n}} \to \mathbf{\Lambda^{n+1}}) \end{array} \right)$$

The entire system is a functor $\mathbf{F}: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{T}$ that transforms a structured domain ($\mathcal{D}$, containing the $\mathbf{0}$-cell and prior coherence history) into a category of metric-weighted $1$- and $2$-cells ($\mathcal{T}$), perpetually elevating the structural stability of the system.
