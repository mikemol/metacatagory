# Dimension 2, Level 1: Foundations

> **Coordinate System:** Dimension 2 (Pedagogy)
> **Level:** 1 (Novice)
> **Parent Index:** $(10, 2)$
> **Context:** The Onboarding Lattice.

Welcome to **Level 1** of the Coherence Induction Lattice. This directory is designed to bootstrap your understanding of the system's "Game Mechanics" (Category Theory & HoTT) through progressive exercises.

***

## 1. The Index (Start Here)

*   **[Level1Index.agda](Level1Index.agda):** The master thread for this level. It imports and braids all sub-modules. Compilation of this file proves you have solved Level 1.

## 2. The Curriculum (Sub-Levels)

The level is stratified into progressive concepts:

1.  **[Level1.agda](Level1.agda):** The primitives. Basic types and identity paths.
2.  **[Level1sub1.agda](Level1sub1.agda):** Introduction to **Sets as Spaces**.
3.  **[Level1sub2.agda](Level1sub2.agda):** Introduction to **Paths** (Equality).
4.  **[Level1sub3.agda](Level1sub3.agda):** Basic **Composition** (1-Cells).
5.  **[Level1sub4.agda](Level1sub4.agda) - [Level1sub8.agda](Level1sub8.agda):** Advanced exercises in commutativity and associativity.

## 3. Learning Objectives

By the end of this level, you should understand:

*   Why we treat Types as Topological Spaces.
*   How to construct a `Path` between two terms.
*   The difference between "Equality" ($=$) and "Identification" ($\equiv$).

## 4. Navigation

*   **Next Level:** [../Chapter2/](../Chapter2/) (Intermediate Structures)
*   **Up:** [../README.md](../README.md) (The Source Atlas)
