# Algebra

Algebraic structures and proofs: groups, rings, fields, modules, and
supporting algebraic foundations.

Primary entry points:
- `Groups/` for group theory modules.
- `Rings/` for ring theory modules.
- `Fields/` for field theory modules.
- `Modules/` for module theory modules.

Some algebra modules are deferred pending Core clean-up. Track progress in
`docs/status/DEFERRED-TRACKING.md`.
