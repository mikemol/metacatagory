ELABORATION: A regular category is a crucial generalization of an abelian category to a non-additive
setting like Set or Grp. It captures the essential 'exactness' properties needed for a good theory of
images and equivalence relations. A deep elaboration requires deconstructing its definition into three
fundamental pillars:

Existence of Structure: The category must have a basic level of structure, namely all finite limits (products, equalizers, pullbacks).

Well-behaved Quotients: There must be a well-defined class of "surjective-like" maps, the regular epimorphisms, which form a factorization system with monomorphisms. A regular epimorphism is one that arises as a coequalizer.

Coherence of Structure: The limit structure and the quotient structure must be compatible. This is captured by the crucial axiom that regular epimorphisms are stable under pullback.

Our formalization will build the master definition of a regular category from these three axioms and then state the key theorem that in such a category, regular epimorphisms are always strong epimorphisms, clarifying their nature.

(*
ELABORATION: This combined elaboration is crucial because, in a regular category, the concepts of "exactness" and "equivalence relation" are deeply intertwined. Unlike in an abelian category, where exactness is defined by Im(f) = Ker(g), here it is defined by the relationship between a quotient map (a regular epimorphism) and its "kernel," which is replaced by the more general notion of a kernel pair.

The main thrust of these sections is to show that a regular category is precisely the right setting to ensure that internal equivalence relations are "effective"—that is, every well-behaved relation gives rise to a well-behaved quotient, and that quotient map perfectly regenerates the original relation as its kernel pair.

Our elaboration will proceed by:

Formalizing the Tools: We will explicitly define the two core concepts: the KernelPairConstructor (which replaces the kernel) and the InternalEquivalenceRelation (the object of study).

Defining the Fundamental Sequence: We will define the canonical "exact sequence" in a regular category: a regular epimorphism presented as the coequalizer of its kernel pair. This is the non-additive analogue of a short exact sequence involving a cokernel.

Stating the Main Theorems: We will formalize the two key theorems that link these concepts:
a. The kernel pair of any regular epimorphism is always an internal equivalence relation.
b. The central theorem: in a regular category, every internal equivalence relation is "effective"—it arises as the kernel pair of its own quotient map (its coequalizer). This is the categorical version of the First Isomorphism Theorem for non-additive structures like sets and groups.

ELABORATION: This section introduces "Barr-exact" categories, a crucial strengthening of regular
categories. While a regular category ensures that quotients by equivalence relations exist and are stable,
an exact category adds the final, powerful condition that these quotients are also "well-behaved" with
respect to composition. This seemingly small addition makes the category behave much more like the
category of Sets and is the key to a powerful embedding theorem.

To elaborate, we will:

Formalize the New Axiom: The key new property for an exact category is that the class of regular
epimorphisms is closed under composition. We will formalize this as a distinct, checkable property.

Construct the Master Definition: We will define a BARR_EXACT_CATEGORY by building directly
upon the REGULAR_CATEGORY definition, adding this new axiom. This shows the hierarchical nature
of these categorical structures.

Define the Structure-Preserving Map: We will define the "correct" kind of functor between
exact categories: a BARR_EXACT_FUNCTOR, which preserves all the relevant structure (finite limits
and regular epimorphisms). This sets the stage for the embedding theorem.
