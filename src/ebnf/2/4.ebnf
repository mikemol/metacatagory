ELABORATION (Deeper Dive): This elaboration refines the formal definition of a monad and its algebras
by separating the data from the axioms, and then instantiates these abstract definitions with the
canonical and most intuitive example: the List Monad in the category of Sets.

This process will demonstrate that:

A monad is a "monoid in the category of endofunctors," with the functor List as the object,
flatten as the multiplication, and singleton as the unit.

An algebra for the List monad is precisely a monoid in the traditional sense. The monad's
coherence laws force the algebra's structure map to behave like an associative binary operation
with a unit.

This makes the abstract definitions concrete and reveals the deep connection between monads and classical algebraic structures.

CATEGORY
[[ THEOREM RankTheoremForMonadicCategories ]] = "A powerful preservation theorem. It asserts that the excellent structural properties of a locally presentable category are preserved when one constructs the category of algebras for a monad of the appropriate rank. This guarantees that the category of algebras for a 'small' algebraic theory is itself 'small' and well-behaved in the same way." ;

(*
ELABORATION: Descent theory addresses a fundamental question in geometry and algebra: when can an object
be reconstructed from "local data"? Given a "cover" map p:U→X, we can study an object E over X by pulling
it back to U, getting pE. This "local data" isn't enough; we also need "gluing data" on the overlaps
(the pullback U×_X U) that tells us how to piece pE back together. The theory of monads provides the
perfect algebraic language for this gluing data. The key insight is that a cover map induces a comonad
(the dual of a monad), and the necessary gluing data for an object is precisely the structure of a
coalgebra for this comonad. When this reconstruction process is perfect, the cover is called an "effective
descent morphism."
