(*
ELABORATION: This section addresses a famous shortcoming of the category of topological spaces,
Top: it is not a "Cartesian Closed Category" (CCC). In a CCC, the operation of taking a product
with an object X, (- × X), must have a right adjoint. The object this adjoint produces is the
"exponential object" or "function space object" Y^X. In Top, this is not always possible.

This section defines the "exponentiable spaces" as precisely those objects X for which this
adjunction exists. A deep elaboration requires us to formalize this "local" version of the CCC
property. We will:

Formalize the Players: Define the category Top and the product functor (- × X).

Formalize the Core Property: Define the property of a space X being EXPONENTIABLE by asserting
the existence of a right adjoint to the product functor.

Formalize the Resulting Structure: Define the EXPONENTIAL_OBJECT Y^X as the result of applying
this right adjoint, and state the resulting Tensor-Hom-like adjunction that defines it.

State the Core Problem: Formalize the theorem that Top is NOT a CCC, which is the motivation for
identifying the special subclass of exponentiable spaces.

ELABORATION: This section provides a solution to the problem identified in 7.1. The category Top is
not cartesian closed, so we seek a "nice" full subcategory that is. The category of Compactly
Generated Weak Hausdorff spaces (CGWH) is such a category. This is a classic categorical strategy:
when your ambient category is poorly behaved, find a well-behaved reflective subcategory to work in.

A deep elaboration requires us to:

Formalize the Properties: Define the constituent properties of the 'nice' spaces.

Construct the Subcategory: Formalize the category CGWH as the full subcategory of Top on
objects with these properties.

Formalize the Reflection: Define the "k-ification" functor k which acts as the reflector
from Top to CGWH, and state its adjunction with the inclusion functor.

State the Main Theorem: Assert the central result: the category CGWH is a Cartesian Closed
Category, which solves the problem.

(*
ELABORATION: This section abstracts a key property of the forgetful functor U: Top → Set. Its
"topological" nature is not just that it forgets structure, but that it allows structure to be
put back in a canonical way. Specifically, for any set X and any collection of functions pointing
to or from it, there is a unique "initial" or "final" topology on X making them all continuous.
This concept is generalized to define a "topological functor."

A deep elaboration requires us to:

Formalize the Lifting Problem: Define the "structured sink" (a set with maps into it)
and "structured source" (a set with maps out of it) that serve as the input data for the lifting problem.

Formalize the Universal Solutions: Define the "Initial Lift" and "Final Lift" as the unique
solutions to these problems. These are the core universal properties.

Define the Master Concept: Define a TOPOLOGICAL_FUNCTOR as a functor that admits initial
lifts for all possible structured sinks.

State the Powerful Consequences: Assert the main theorem that a topological functor is
extremely well-behaved: its domain is complete and cocomplete, and it has both a left and
right adjoint. This shows why the property is so important.
