ELABORATION: This section introduces the concept of an "exact" functor, which is fundamental in
algebra and homological algebra. Exactness relates to the preservation of a specific class of
limits and colimits, namely finite ones. To elaborate, we will:

Formalize "Finite": Define what it means for a category, limit, or colimit to be finite.

Define the Properties: Formalize the properties LEFT_EXACT, RIGHT_EXACT, and EXACT for a
functor based on its preservation of these finite structures.

Assert the Duality: Use the Duality Principle to formally state that LEFT_EXACT and
RIGHT_EXACT are dual concepts.

Provide the Canonical Example: Assert the theorem that in an abelian category, an additive functor
is left exact if and only if it preserves kernels, a classic and practical test.

ELABORATION: To provide a deeper elaboration on the Cauchy completion, we will deconstruct
the Karoubi envelope construction into its finest parts. We are moving beyond just stating
its existence and universal property to formalizing its very machinery. We will:

Formalize the Objects and Morphisms: We will create explicit rules not just for the objects of
the Karoubi envelope Kar(C) (which are pairs (A, e)), but also for its morphisms. This makes
the internal structure of Kar(C) fully transparent within our grammar.

Formalize the Universal Functor: We will define the canonical embedding functor Y: C -> Kar(C)
that injects the original category into its completion, specifying its action on both objects
and morphisms.

Connect to Other Limit Concepts: We will state the important theorem that any category with
all equalizers is already Cauchy complete. This provides a practical criterion for checking
the property and contextualizes it within the broader theory of limits.

Refine the Universal Property Theorem: By formalizing the components above, our statement of
the universal property of Kar(C) becomes more concrete and its proof more apparent from the

ELABORATION (Deeper Dive): The previous elaboration stated the Refined General Adjoint Functor Theorem (GAFT).
A deeper elaboration requires formalizing the constructive proof of this theorem. The theorem's
power lies in showing how the existence of a weakly initial set, combined with limit preservation,
allows one to build the universal arrow for each object, which in turn builds the left adjoint.

This elaboration will formalize the key lemma and the constructive steps of this proof:

Formalize the Lemma: A key lemma is that if a functor G preserves limits, then the comma
category (c ↓ G) inherits completeness from G's domain. We will formalize this.

Formalize the Construction: We will create a meta-rule, GAFT_ConstructiveProof, that
outlines the steps: (1) Find the weakly initial set, (2) Use it to construct an initial
object in the comma category, (3) This initial object IS the universal arrow, (4) Repeat
for all objects to build the adjunction.

Formalize the "Engine": We will define the constructor ConstructInitialObject which embodies
the core of the proof mechanism (taking a product, then a limit).

This approach transforms the theorem from a static assertion into a dynamic, constructive process
within the grammar itself.
