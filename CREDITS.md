The structure of this system is largely inspired by the *index* of the "Handbook of Categorical Algebra." The content was generatively constructed by applying the metamodel to develop the proofs and concepts outlined in the index, with the assistance of a language model. Without the accessibility and depth of the Handbook, achieving a computable grammar grounded in such foundational aspects of Category Theory would not have been possible.
